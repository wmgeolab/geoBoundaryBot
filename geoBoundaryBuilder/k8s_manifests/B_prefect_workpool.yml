#Prefect itself is made up of three core components on the server level:
#Work Pools - The type of resources available.  We'll be using kubernetes.
#Workers - These are the workers available to a work pool.  We'll only need one of these, as it's job will be to submit other jobs to kubernetes.
#Deployments - These are the actual scripts you're running.
#The first pod we are going to create will simply dial into the prefect server and create a kubernetes work pool, and then join that workpool as a worker.
#Note that a "worker" in this case doesn't really do any work - it's just the process that handles submitting jobs to K8S later on.
#We're going to create a processor-only K8S workpool for now, using a basic python base image as an example.
#To run this on your own, all you should need to do is change the IP address in the environmental variables pointing to the Prefect Server.
